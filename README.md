Task Manager Program
This is a demo Task Manager program implemented in C++. It loads, displays, and allows you to sort processes from the system. The program is designed to interact with a user through a command-line interface and supports sorting processes by Name, PID (Process ID), and Memory Usage. The program fetches process data from the system using the tasklist command, and allows the user to filter and organize processes in various ways.

Features

Sort by Process ID (PID): Sorts processes by their PID in either ascending or descending order.
Sort by Memory Usage: Sorts processes by their memory usage, from smallest to largest or vice versa.
User Interaction: The program provides an interactive menu system where users can choose actions.
